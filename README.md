##algodat - Algorithms & Data Structures
=======

This is a collection of problems I solved during the "HI1029 Algorithmer & Datastructurer" course in 2012 at The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. The majority of problems are solved with C, but some in Java when the nature of the problem required it.

I did these in 2012 but have uploaded them to GitHub for future reference.
