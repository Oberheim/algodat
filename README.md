algodat - Algorithms & Data Structures
=======

This is a collection of problems I solved during the <i>"HI1029 Algorithmer & Datastructurer"</i> course in 2012 at the <i>Royal Institute of Technology</i> (KTH) in Stockholm. The majority of problems are solved with C, but some in Java when the nature of the problem required it.

I did these in 2012 but have uploaded them to GitHub for future reference.
